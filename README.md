# Shortly

A simple application that allows you to shorten long urls using the [Clean URI API](https://cleanuri.com/docs).

This idea is from the [Shortly URL shortening API Challenge challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G).
However, I am doing this so I can learn Flutter.

## Progress

**In development**

There's still a lot to be done. The users should be able to:

- [ ] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- [x] Shorten any valid URL
- [ ] See a list of their shortened links, even after closing the application (currently, they can see a list but it is not kept in persistent storage yet)
- [ ] Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- [ ] Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - [ ] The `TextField` field is empty
  - [ ] The value of the `TextField` is not a valid url
